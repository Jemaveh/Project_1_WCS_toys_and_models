# Project_1_WCS_toys_and_models
My first project during my studies at Wild Code School

# Instructions

You are commissioned by a company selling models and scale models. The company already  has a database that lists employees, products, orders, and much more. You are invited to browse and discover this database. 
The director of the company wishes to have a dashboard which he could refresh each morning to have the latest information in order to manage the company.
## Your dashboard should revolve around these 4 main topics: sales, finance, logistics, and human resources:
- Sales: The number of products sold by category and by month, with comparison  and rate of change compared to the same month of the previous year.
- Finances: The turnover of the orders of the last two months by country. Orders that have not yet been paid.
- Logistics: The stock of the 5 most ordered products.
- Human Resources: Each month, the 2 sellers with the highest turnover.
Nota bene: sometimes business indicators are not technically achievable

## Data
Local installation :
You can install a MySQL Community server on your machine, as well as the MySQL Workbench client.
